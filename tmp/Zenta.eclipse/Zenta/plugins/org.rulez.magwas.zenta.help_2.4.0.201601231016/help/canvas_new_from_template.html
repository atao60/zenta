<h2>Creating a New Canvas from a Template</h2>
<p>To create a new Canvas based on an existing template follow  these steps:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Select the &quot;Views&quot; folder for the chosen Model in the Model Tree, right-click on it and select &quot;New-&gt;Canvas from Template...&quot; A wizard will open:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/canvas_new_from_template_wizard1.png" width="696" height="654">
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Choose the desired template. Some are provided in the &quot;Installed Templates&quot; section while user-created templates are listed in their categories in the &quot;My Templates&quot;       section (see &quot;<a href="canvas_save_as_template.html">Saving a  Canvas as a Template</a>&quot;). The selected template's name and description are displayed in the Gallery's preview window.</li>
     <li>You can resize the thumbnail images in the Gallery by using the resize slider control.</li>
  <li>If you wish to open a template from file that is not shown in the wizard select the &quot;Open...&quot; item. A file dialog will allow you to choose a &quot;*.archicanvas&quot; template file.</li>
     <li>Press  Finish. A new Canvas is created and added to the &quot;Views&quot; folder in the Model Tree where you can edit the default name. The View itself will be open ready for you to edit.</li>
