<h2>Showing a View in Full Screen Mode</h2>

<p>On Windows and Linux, a View can be displayed and edited in Full Screen mode (this is not available on the Mac OS X version of Zenta since OS X has its own full screen support). This can be useful to maximise the View for presentation purposes. To do so select a View and press the F11 key, or choose the "Full Screen" menu item from the main "View" menu. The View will be maximised:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="img/view_fullscreen.png" alt="" width="700"><br>
A View in Full Screen mode</p>

<p>The Floating Palette window can be closed with the Escape key or the window's close button. Right-clicking on the View in Full Screen mode invokes a context menu where the Palette may be shown if it is not currently visible.</p>
