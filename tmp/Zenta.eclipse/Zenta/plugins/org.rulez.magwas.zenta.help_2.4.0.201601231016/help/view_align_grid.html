<h2>Alignment Tools, Guides and the Grid</h2>

    <td width="30%" valign="top"><strong>Zoom in / Zoom out:</strong></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">Zoom in and out of the diagram.  This is also available on the toolbar as a combo box. You can also Zoom in and  out by holding the Ctrl key and scrolling the mouse wheel.</td>
