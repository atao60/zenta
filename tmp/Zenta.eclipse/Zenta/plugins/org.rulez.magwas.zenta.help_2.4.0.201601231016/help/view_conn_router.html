<h2>Setting the Connection Router Type for a View</h2>
<p>By default, connections are drawn as straight lines from  element to element. Bend-points can be added to a connection as detailed <a href="view_conn_bendpoints.html">here</a>. However, it is possible to set the overall connection router type so that the connections route around elements or are drawn orthogonally.</p>
<p>The connection router type can be set either from the main &quot;View-&gt;Connection Router&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View or from the &quot;Appearance&quot; tab in the <a href="properties_view.html">Properties Window</a> when the View canvas is selected.</p>
<p>The available router types are as follows:</p>
<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>Connections are drawn in straight lines. Bend-points can be added by the user.</p>

<h3>Shortest Path</h3>
<p>Connections are drawn to avoid elements and route  around them. Bend-points can be added by the user.</p>
