    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
	<p>Zenta is a free, open source, cross-platform tool to create models.</p>
    
	<p><strong>Zenta</strong> is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Architects and Enterprise Modellers. It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e. free) solution to users who may be making their first steps in modeling and who are looking for a cross-platform modelling tool for their company or institution. Zenta fulfils the needs of most Enterprise Architects and associated stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Zenta is forked from Archi, with the main goal to becoma a metamodel-driven modeling tool</p>
    
	<p>The development of Archi has been funded by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> and has been developed by Phillip Beauvoir for <a href="http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/">JISC CETIS</a>.</p>
