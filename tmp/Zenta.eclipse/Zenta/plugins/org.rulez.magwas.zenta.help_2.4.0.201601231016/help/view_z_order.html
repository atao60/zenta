<h2>Setting the Order of Overlapping Elements</h2>
<p>Overlapping elements in a View can be brought to the front  or back, or brought forward or sent back. This is also known as the &quot;Z&quot; order.  This is achieved by selecting the element in a View and right-clicking to  invoke the &quot;Order&quot; menu items. These same menu items are also available from  the main &quot;View&quot; menu.</p>
