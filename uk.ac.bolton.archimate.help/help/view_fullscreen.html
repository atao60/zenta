<h2>Showing a View in Full Screen Mode</h2>
<p>A View can be displayed and edited in Full Screen mode. This can be useful to maximise the View for presentation purposes. To do so select a View and press the F11 key on Windows or the Shift-Command-F keys on Mac, or choose the &quot;Full Screen&quot; menu item from the main &quot;View&quot; menu. The View will be maximised:</p>
<p><span class="caption"><img src="img/view_fullscreen.png" alt="" width="686" height="534"><br>
A View in Full Screen mode</span></p>
<p>The Palette is of the &quot;floating&quot; type and may be closed with the Escape key or the window's close button. Right-clicking on the View brings up a context menu where the Palette may be shown if it is not currently visible.</p>
