<h2>Adding Images to Elements</h2>
<p>Canvas Blocks, Image place-holders and Stickies can contain images. The images in Blocks and Stickies are icons and are resized to a maximum width and height of 100 pixels. Images can be any size but we suggest that you keep them reasonably small so as not to consume too many resources.</p>
<p>To add an image to one of these elements, open the Properties window and select the element. Double-clicking the element on the Canvas will also open the Properties window. Find the Image tab in the Properties window and select the Image Chooser with the &quot;Set Image...&quot; option:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="img/image_chooser.png" width="242" height="101"><br>
Selecting the Image Chooser from the Properties window</p>
<p>This will open the &quot;My Images&quot; Image Chooser dialog window:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="img/image_chooser_dialog.png" width="677" height="581"><br>
  The Image Chooser dialog window
</p>
<p>All images that are contained in any loaded models are displayed in the Chooser so that you can re-use them. If you wish to open an image file from your computer select the &quot;Open from File...&quot; option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="boxout"><img src="img/tip.png" alt="" width="13" height="18"> You can drag and drop Image files from the desktop to the Canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Removing an image from an element</strong></p>
