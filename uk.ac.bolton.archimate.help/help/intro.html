<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Archi is a free, open source, cross-platform tool to create  ArchiMate models.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archimate.org/">ArchiMate</a><sup><a href="appendix.html">1</a></sup> is an open and independent Enterprise Architecture modelling language that  supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and  across business domains. ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</a><sup>1</sup> and is based on  the IEEE 1471 standard.</p>
<p>Archi is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Architects  and Enterprise Modellers. It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e.  free) solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate  language or who are looking for a fully-featured, professional cross-platform  ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or institution. Archi more than  adequately fulfils the needs of Enterprise Architects and associated  stakeholders.</p>
<p>Since its introduction, Archi has been widely adopted for  real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used in-house  by major global companies and consultants. It is rapidly becoming the <em>de facto</em> ArchiMate modelling tool.</p>
<p>The development of Archi has been funded by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> and has been developed by Phillip  Beauvoir for <a href="http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/">JISC CETIS</a> at the <a href="http://www.bolton.ac.uk/">University of Bolton</a>.</p>
