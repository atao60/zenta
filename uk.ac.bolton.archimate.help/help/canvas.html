<h1>The Canvas Modelling Toolkit</h1>
<p>The Canvas Modelling Toolkit is an extension to Archi somewhat akin to the <a href="sketch_view.html">Sketch View</a> that provides the tools for you to create and edit a &quot;Canvas&quot; such as the <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas" target="_blank">Business Model Canvas</a><sup><a href="appendix.html">2</a></sup>. With the Canvas Modelling Toolkit you can design and create re-usable Canvas Templates to share with colleagues or simply or you can use it as a pre-design tool to sketch out ideas and models. You can also link to other Views in your model so you could, for example, link  from an ArchiMate View to a Business Model Canvas View to provide a Business Plan.</p>
