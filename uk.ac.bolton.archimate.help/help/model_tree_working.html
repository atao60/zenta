<h2>Deleting Elements from the Model Tree</h2>
<p>To delete one or more elements in the Model Tree select them  and choose &quot;Delete&quot; from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu or from the main toolbar.</p>
<p>Note that if an element that you wish to delete appears in  one or more Views you will be warned that it is referenced in those Views. <strong>If you then delete the element from the  tree you will also delete it from any Views where it is referenced.</strong></p>

<h2>Renaming an Element in the Model Tree</h2>
<p>To rename an element or  relationship in the Model Tree choose &quot;Rename&quot; from the main Edit menu or from the right-click context menu. You can also rename it in the <a href="properties_element.html">Properties Window</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Duplicating an Element or View in the Model Tree</h2>
<p>To duplicate Elements or Views in the Model Tree select &quot;Duplicate&quot; from the main &quot;Edit&quot; menu or from the right-click context menu. Note that Duplicate Views contain references to the original elements copied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Editing Properties for an Element in the Model Tree</h2>
<p>To edit the Properties for a selected element or  relationship in the Model Tree, select the tree node and open the Properties Window  either by double-clicking the tree node or from the main &ldquo;Window&rdquo; menu or main toolbar.</p>
<p>Each element in the Model Tree has different properties that  can be set or viewed in the Properties Window. For more information see the  section, <a href="properties_window.html">The Properties Window</a>.</p>
<p>Note - some properties can only be edited when the element  is selected in a View (for example, the fill colour, font or line width).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Elements in the Model Tree and Views</h2>
<p>Elements in the Model Tree  can be added to any number of diagram Views in the model by dragging them onto  the View's canvas (see the section, &quot;Views&quot;). When an element has been added or  used in a View the font used in the Model Tree for that element is normal.  However, if the element only exists in the Model Tree and is not used in any  View it is shown with an <em>italic</em> font:</p>
<p class="caption"><img width="291" height="419" src="img/model-tree-italic.png"><br>
Italic font shows elements not used in Views</p>
<p>This makes it convenient to  see those elements that may have become redundant and can be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Synchronising Selections in the Model Tree and a View</h2>
<p>When selecting elements in the Model Tree and in diagram  Views it is sometimes useful to synchronise the selection between the elements in  both windows. Pressing the &quot;Link to View&quot; button in the Model Tree window  allows this to happen:</p>
<p class="caption"><img width="292" height="387" src="img/model-tree-sync.png"><br>
The &quot;Link to View&quot; button</p>
<p>This button is a toggle and can be turned off.</p>
<p>Synchronised selection is possible on more than one selected  element.</p>
<p>Note  that synchronised selection is only possible if a relevant View is open. Selecting an element in the Model Tree will not synchronise a selection in a  View if that View does not contain that particular element or elements.</p>
