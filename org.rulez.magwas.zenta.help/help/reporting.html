<h2>Jasper Reports</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/jasperreports" target="_blank">Jasper Reports</a> is the world's most popular Java reporting engine. Combine data sources and   produce pixel-perfect documents that can be viewed, printed, or   exported into a variety of document formats with this powerful reporting   tool. Archi can export models in various formats using Jasper Reports Templates.</p>
<p>This option is available from the &quot;Report-&gt;Jasper...&quot; menu  item from the main &quot;File&quot; menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or  in a View this menu item is enabled. Provide the details in the following wizard:</p>

<h2>HTML Reports</h2>
<p>Archi supports a basic reporting functionality by means of generating  a single HTML page containing summary tables of the model elements and the  Views in a model.</p>
<p>This option is available from the &quot;Report-&gt;HTML...&quot; menu  item from the main &quot;File&quot; menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or  in a View this menu item is enabled. Select a folder to export the model and  its Views.</p>
<p>A  single HTML page, &quot;report.html&quot; is generated in the chosen output folder  together with image files for the Views in the model.</p>
