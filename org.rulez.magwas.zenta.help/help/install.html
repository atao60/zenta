	<h1>Installing and Launching Zenta</h1>
	<p>Download the required version from <a href="http://archi.cetis.ac.uk/download.html">http://archi.cetis.ac.uk/download.html</a></p>
	<p>The Windows version is installed by means of an executable  installer. Run the installer wizard to install Zenta to your system. Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7/8 32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported.</p>
	<p>The Mac and Linux versions are packaged in zip and tar.gz  files respectively. Simply un-archive the downloaded archive file and double-click the &quot;Zenta&quot; application file to launch the program.</p>

	<h2>Example models</h2>
	<p>Alongside the Zenta installation is an &quot;examples&quot; folder  containing a few simple ZentaMate example models. You can open these in Zenta  from the &quot;Open&quot; menu.</p>

	<h2>Launching Zenta</h2>
	<p>The new, blank Zenta workspace looks like the following:</p>

	The Default Zenta Workspace</p>

	<p>The workspace is divided into the following sub-windows:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>The <strong>Models</strong> Tree window. By default this is positioned at the top left and labelled &quot;Models&quot;. This is where one or more ZentaMate models can       be viewed as a tree structure.</li>
  		<li>The <strong>Properties</strong> window. This displays the properties for a selected ZentaMate element. The properties for the selected element can be edited       here.</li>
  		<li>The <strong>Outline </strong>window. This window displays the contents of an ZentaMate diagram (View) in miniature as a navigation tool for the selected diagram (View).</li>
  		<li>The <strong>Navigator</strong> window. This window displays the selected model element and all of its relationships with other model elements. It is used to navigate between connected elements via their relationships and is used in conjunction with the Models Tree window.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Palette</strong> window. When opened will display a single window for the drawing Palette used in Views.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Visualiser</strong> window. This window displays the selected model element and all of its relationships with other model elements in a graphical way. It is the graphical equivalent of the Navigator.</li>
		<li>The <strong>Hints</strong> window. This displays short textual hints for the selected object. For example, selecting an ZentaMate &quot;Business Actor&quot;       diagram element displays a short summary of that object's meaning and purpose. Selecting an item or hovering over an item, in the diagram's palette also displays a hint in the window.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These sub-windows can be re-arranged by dragging them into  new positions, or by dragging them out of the main application window to become detached from the main window.</p>
	<p>The various windows may be shown or hidden by selecting the appropriate  menu items from the &quot;Window&quot; menu on the main menu bar or from the buttons on  the toolbar:</p>
	<p class="caption"><img src="img/windows-toolbar.png" alt="Windows Toolbar" border="0"><br/>The Windows Toolbar</p>

	<p>To reset the Zenta window workspace to its default layout,  select &quot;<strong>Reset Window Layout</strong>&quot; from the &quot;Window&quot; menu from the main menu.</p>
	<p>You can hide or show the main toolbar by selecting  &quot;Hide/Show Toolbar&quot; from the &quot;Window&quot; menu from the main menu.</p>
