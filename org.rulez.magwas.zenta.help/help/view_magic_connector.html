<h2>Adding New Relationships  and Elements to the View using the  Magic Connector</h2>
<p>Connecting one element to another in a View depends on  whether the relationship is allowed according to the ArchiMate specification.  For example, you cannot connect an Assignment relationship from an Application  Component to a Business Actor. Unless you are very familiar with the rules governing the relationships in ArchiMate it can be frustrating to find the allowable  relationships between one element and another. The &quot;Magic Connector&quot;  solves this problem.</p>

The Magic Connector in the Palette</p>
<p>The Magic Connector has two uses - firstly to create a new  allowed connection between one element and another, and secondly to create a  new element and an allowed connection between the source element and the  newly created element.</p>
<p>To create a connection between a source and a target element  using the Magic Connector follow these steps:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Select the Magic Connector tool from the palette</li>
  <li>Click on the source element in the View</li>
  <li>Click on the target element in the View</li>
  <li>A popup menu will appear showing the allowable relationships between the two elements. Choose the required type from the menu</li>
</ol>

Drawing a connection using the Magic Connector</p>
<p>To create a new element and connection in one operation  using the Magic Connector follow these steps:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Select the Magic Connector tool from the palette</li>
  <li>Click on the source element</li>
  <li>Click on a blank area of the View's canvas, or on a Group figure</li>
  <li>A cascading popup menu will appear showing all allowable elements and relationships between the two. Choose the required element and connection from the menu</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following example a new Business Role element will be  created together with a new Assignment relationship connecting to the original  selected Business Actor element.</p>

Using the Magic Connector to create a new  element and connection</p>
<p>If you hold the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key (&quot;Command&quot; key on Mac) down at the same time  as clicking on a blank area of the canvas then the Connections will be shown first  followed by the elements in the popup menus (this can be reversed in <a href="prefs_connections.html">Preferences</a>):</p>
