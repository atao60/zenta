<h2>Folders and Organisation</h2>
<p>A model in Zenta is organised into a basic folder structure  representing the three ZentaMate &quot;layers&quot; and the elements' relationships. A  new model comprises the following top level folders:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="20%"><strong>Business</strong></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top">Contains the elements in  the &quot;Business&quot; layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Application</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the elements in the  &quot;Application&quot; layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Technology</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the elements in the  &quot;Technology&quot; layer and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Motivation</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the elements in the  &quot;Motivation&quot; extension and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Implementation &amp; Migration</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the elements in the  &quot;Implementation &amp; Migration&quot; extension and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Connectors</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the Junction type  elements and any user-created sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Relations</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains the relationships  between elements as they are created in Views (diagrams) and any user-created  sub-folders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Views</strong></td>
    <td valign="top">Contains links to  Views (diagrams)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Elements can be created and deleted directly in the Model  Tree (see <a href="model_tree_add.html">Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</a>) or are automatically  added to the appropriate type folder as objects are drawn onto the canvas of a  View (see <a href="view_addnew.html">Adding New Elements to the View from the Palette</a>). All elements in  a folder are automatically sorted alphabetically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>User-Created Sub-Folders</h3>
<p>User sub-folders can be created under the main top-level  folders. This allows you to organise the elements in any way you wish. To add a  new sub-folder to the Model Tree, select a top-level folder (or a user-created  sub-folder), and right-click. A &quot;New&quot; menu item allows you to add a new  sub-folder to the tree.</p>
<p>Note that a sub-folder can only contain elements of the same  type as the topmost parent folder. For example, only &quot;Business&quot; type elements  can be created in the &quot;Business&quot; folder and any of its sub-folders.</p>
<p>You  can also drag and drop elements and sub-folders within the same folder branch,  but not across folders of different types.</p>
<p>To rename a sub-folder in the Model Tree choose &quot;Rename&quot; from the main Edit menu or from the right-click context menu.</p>
