<h1>The Outline Window</h1>
<p>The Outline window acts as a miniature viewport onto the  selected diagram View in order to aid in navigation if the diagram is too large  to fit in the window.</p>
<p>To open or close the Outline window, choose the option from  the main &ldquo;Window&rdquo; menu or from the main toolbar.</p>
If  the View that is being edited is too large to fit into the application&rsquo;s window  then a navigation pane will appear in the Outline window. Dragging this  navigation pane will scroll the elements into view in the drawing canvas.
