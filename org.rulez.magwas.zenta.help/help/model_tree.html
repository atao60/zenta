<h1>The Model Tree</h1>
<p>A model consists of a number of elements.
</p>
<p>Each element in the model can connect to one or more other  elements via one or more relationships (connections).</p>
<p>Until you create a template view (or load a model with it), you will have only one type of element and relationship. You can define other types with creating metamodels. A metamodel is just a view with a property called "template"</p>
<p>A model consists of configurations of these  elements connected to each other via the various relationships. The normative model is represented in Zenta in the &quot;Models&quot; window as a tree structure  organised into folders:</p>
