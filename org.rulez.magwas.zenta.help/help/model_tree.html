<h1>The Model Tree</h1>
<p>An ZentaMate 2.0 model consists of a number of ZentaMate  elements belonging to three &quot;layers&quot; - the &quot;Business&quot; layer, the &quot;Application&quot;  layer and the &quot;Technology&quot; layer. Each ZentaMate element belongs to one of  these layers. For example, a &quot;Business Object&quot; belongs to the &quot;Business&quot; layer  and an &quot;Application Component&quot; belongs to the Application layer. The following  is a list of all the ZentaMate elements grouped by their layers:</p>
<p><strong><em>Business Layer<br>
  </em></strong>Business actor<br>
  Business role<br>
  Business collaboration<br>
  Business interface<br>
  Business object<br>
  Business process<br>
  Business function<br>
  Business interaction<strong><em><br>
  </em></strong>Business event<br>
  Business service<br>
  Representation<br>
  Meaning<br>
  Value<strong><em><br>
  </em></strong>Product<br>
  Contract<br>
  Location
</p>
<p><strong><em>Application Layer<br>
  </em></strong>Application component<br>
  Application collaboration<br>
  Application interface<br>
  Data object<br>
  Application function<br>
  Application interaction<br>
  Application service</p>
<p><strong><em>Technology Layer<br>
  </em></strong>Node<br>
  Device<br>
  Network<br>
  Communication path<br>
  Infrastructure interface<br>
  Infrastructure function  <br>
  System software<br>

<p>The ZentaMate 2.0 specification introduces the additional following extensions and concepts:</p>
<p><strong><em>Motivation<br>
</em></strong>Stakeholder<br> 
Driver<br>
Assessment<br> 
Goal<br>
Principle<br>
Requirement<br> 
Constraint</p>
<p><strong><em>Implementation &amp; Migration<br>
</em></strong>Work package<br> 
Deliverable
<br> 
Plateau
<br> 
Gap
</p>
<p>Each element in the model can connect to one or more other  elements via one or more relationships (connections). These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>Relationships<br>
  </em></strong>Association<br>
  Access<br>
  Used by<br>
  Realization<br>
  Assignment<br>
  Aggregation<br>
  Composition<br>
  Flow<br>
  Triggering<br>
  Grouping<br>
  Junction<br>
  Specialization<br>
  Influence
</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to explain these  elements and their relationships. For more information refer to the ZentaMate   Specification Guide (available from <a href="http://www.zenta.org/">http://www.zenta.org/</a>)</p>
<p>An ZentaMate model consists of configurations of these  elements connected to each other via the various relationships. The normative model is represented in Zenta in the &quot;Models&quot; window as a tree structure  organised into folders:</p>
