    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
	<p>Zenta is a free, open source, cross-platform tool to create ZentaMate models.</p>
    
	<p><a href="http://www.archimate.org/">ZentaMate</a><sup><a href="appendix.html">1</a></sup> is an open and independent Enterprise Zentatecture modelling language that supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ZentaMate is one of the open standards hosted by <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/" target="_blank">The Open Group</a><sup>1</sup> and is fully aligned with <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/" target="_new">TOGAF</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
	<p><strong>Zenta</strong> is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Zentatects and Enterprise Modellers. It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e. free) solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ZentaMate language or who are looking for a cross-platform ZentaMate modelling tool for their company or institution. Zenta fulfils the needs of most Enterprise Zentatects and associated stakeholders, but it can also be regarded as an introductory ZentaMate tool for those wishing to engage with the language before committing to a commercial solution.</p>
    
	<p>Since its introduction, Zenta has been widely adopted for real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used in-house  by major global companies and consultants. It is rapidly becoming the <em>de facto</em> open source ZentaMate modelling tool.</p>
    
	<p>The development of Zenta has been funded by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> and has been developed by Phillip Beauvoir for <a href="http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk/">JISC CETIS</a>.</p>
