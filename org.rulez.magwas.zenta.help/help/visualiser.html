	<h1>The Visualiser Window</h1>
	
	<p>The Visualiser window displays the selected model element and all of its relationships with other model elements in a graphical way. It is the graphical equivalent of the Navigator. Selecting an element or relationship in the Model Tree, the Navigator or in a Diagram View will update the selection in the Visualiser.</p>

	<p>To use the Visualiser, select any element or relationship in the Model Tree, the Navigator, or in a View. The Visualiser will update to reflect the current selection. The Visualiser highlights the selected element and shows all relationships and any connected elements. Double-clicking on one of the connected elements allows you to "Go Into" to the element so that it is the focal central element, and all of its relationships and connected elements are displayed. You can also "Go Into" an element from the toolbar in the Visualiser window, and also select "Back" to return to the previous element. Select "Home" on the toolbar to return to the first selected element.</p>

	<p>The Visualiser will display the selected element's connected elements to a default depth of one level (immediate connections). To change the depth level of how far the connections are calculated, select the Depth level from the drop-down menu in the Visualiser window:</p>

	<p>Selecting an element or relationship in the Model Tree, the Navigator, or in a View will update the focussed selection in the Visualiser window. To stop this from updating, you can press the "Pins the current view" button on the toolbar in the Visualiser window.</p>

	<p>The first time a focussed element is displayed in the Visualiser window it is laid out with an animation. This animation can be turned off in <a href="prefs_general.html">Preferences</a>. If you wish to re-layout, you can press the "Layout" button on the toolbar in the Visualiser window.
