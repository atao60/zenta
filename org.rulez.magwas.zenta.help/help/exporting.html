<h1>Exporting the Model and its Views</h1>
<p>It is possible to export the Zenta model or its Views to  different formats in order to re-use the model or images in different  applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Export Model To CSV</h2>
<p>This option is available from the &quot;Export Model To  CSV...&quot; menu item from the main &quot;File-&gt;Export&quot; menu. Once a model is  selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Provide a  filename to export the file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.</p>
<p>The CSV field format is as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Type&quot;, &quot;Element name&quot;, &quot;Documentation&quot;, &quot;Source type&quot;, &quot;Source name&quot;, &quot;Target type&quot;, &quot;Target name&quot;</p>
<p>Elements and Relationships are exported. The last four fields only apply to the Relationship type. For an element they are left blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Export View As Image</h2>
<p>A View (diagram) can be exported as an image file to disk.  This is available from the &quot;Export View As Image...&quot; menu command from the main  &quot;File-&gt;Export&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View and selecting the menu  item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only available if a View is  open and selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Export View As Image to Clipboard</h2>
<p>A  View (diagram) can be exported (or copied) as an image to the system clipboard.  This is available from the &quot;Export View As Image To Clipboard&quot; menu command  from the main &quot;File-&gt;Export&quot; menu or by right-clicking on a View and  selecting the menu item from the contextual menu. This menu command is only  available if a View is open and selected. A useful shortcut key combination is  Ctrl-Shift-C (Command key on Mac). Once the View is exported to the system clipboard it can be  pasted into other applications such as word processing and drawing tools.</p>
