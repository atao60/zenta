<h1>The Navigator Window</h1>
<p>The Navigator window displays the currently selected model  element and all of its relationships with other elements. It is used to display  and allow navigation between connected elements via their relationships and is  used in conjunction with the Model Tree window and Views.</p>
<p>The Model Tree acts as a &quot;flat&quot; repository for all the  elements, relationships and Views in a model. Views are graphical  configurations of those elements. However, the Navigator is able to show all of  an element's relationships at the model level regardless of how they are  presented in a View.</p>
<p>To use the Navigator window, select any element or  relationship in the Model Tree or in a View. The Navigator tree will update to  reflect the current selection. The tree shows the &quot;root&quot; selected element and  any relationships that stem from it and any &quot;target&quot; elements from those  relationships:</p>

<p>In the above screenshot the user has selected the element &quot;CRM System&quot;. There are three Realisation  relationships between the selected element and the three elements &quot;Customer  Administration Service&quot;, &quot;Insurance Application Service&quot;, and &quot;CIS&quot;. From these  three elements further relationships are shown between them and their target  elements.</p>
<p>It is possible, therefore, to &quot;dig in&quot; to the Navigator tree  and traverse from element to element following it and its child relationships  from source to target.</p>
<p>A selected sub-element can become the &quot;root&quot; element by  either double-clicking on it in the tree or by clicking on the &quot;Go Into&quot; button  on the window's toolbar:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="img/navigator2.png" width="313" height="143"><br>
The &quot;Go Into&quot; Button</p>
<p>Conversely, pressing the &quot;Back&quot; button takes you back to the  previously selected element:</p>

The &quot;Back&quot; button</p>
<p>The &quot;Home&quot; button takes you back to the main root element  that was originally selected:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="img/navigator4.png" width="312" height="132"><br>
The &quot;Home&quot; button</p>
<p>By default, the Navigator shows relationships that flow from  the source to the target element. It is possible to reverse this to show the  element's relations that flow from the target to the source by clicking on the  &quot;Show source relations&quot; button on the window's toolbar:</p>

Show source relations mode</p>
<p>In the above screenshot the element &quot;CRM System&quot; is the target of the two &quot;Used By&quot; relationships. So  the flow is from &quot;Mainframe&quot; to &quot;Claim Files Service&quot; to &quot;CRM System&quot;, and from  &quot;NAS File Server&quot; to &quot;Customer File Service&quot; to &quot;CRM System&quot;.</p>
The  selected element can be &quot;pinned&quot; if required by selecting the pin button in the  Navigator window:

The &quot;pin&quot; button</p>
<p>It is also possible to drag and drop any selected elements  and/or relationships from the Navigator Tree to a View, in exactly the same way  as dragging from the Model Tree to a View (see <a href="view_addexisting.html">Adding Elements and Relations from the Model Tree to a View</a>)</p>
