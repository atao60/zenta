<h2>Setting the Properties of a Connection</h2>
<p>A Connection's (Relationship's) properties can be edited by  selecting the connection on the View and opening the Properties Window. See the  section, <a href="properties_relation_appearance.html">Relationship Connection  Appearance Properties</a>, for more information.</p>
<p>Text can be added to a connection (on the &quot;Main&quot; tab) and displayed in one of three positions,  and the thickness of the line itself can be set as can the text's font and colour. The  following screenshot shows a connection with a medium line width and text showing  in the &ldquo;Target&rdquo; position with a blue italic font and purple line colour:</p>
