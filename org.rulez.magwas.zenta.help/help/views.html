<h1>Views</h1>
<p>The elements and relationships that constitute  an ArchiMate model as represented in the Model Tree can be arranged into one or  more &quot;Views&quot; or visual diagrams. Therefore an ArchiMate model can consist of  one or more Views where each View can display the model elements in various configurations.  For example, you may wish to only see the Business Layer elements in one View  and the model's Application Interface elements in another View. Or you may wish  to create a &quot;master&quot; View that acts as a map to all of the other Views in the  model.</p>
<p>ArchiMate advocates an  approach in which architects and other stakeholders can define their own Views  on the enterprise architecture. In this approach, Views are specified by <em>viewpoints</em>.   Viewpoints define abstractions on the  set of models representing the enterprise architecture, each aimed at a   particular type of stakeholder and addressing a particular  set of concerns. Viewpoints can both be used to view certain aspects in   isolation, and for relating two or more aspects.</p>
<p>In Archi a View is unlimited in scope according to the available elements and relations, and it is up to the designer to impose any constraints for a given viewpoint as prescribed by the ArchiMate specification.</p>
