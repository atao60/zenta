<h2>Adding a Junction</h2>
<p>A Junction element can be added from the View's palette in  the Relations palette section:</p>

The Junction entry in the Palette</p>
<p>The palette entry is a three-way drop-down box, so three  different types of junction can be added - &quot;Junction&quot;, &quot;And Junction&quot;, and &quot;Or  Junction&quot;. A Junction is used to connect dynamic relationships of the same  type. A Junction is used in a number of situations to connect dynamic (triggering  or flow) relationships of the same type; for example, to indicate splits or joins.</p>
<p>Junctions appear in the Model tree in the  &quot;Connectors&quot; folder. They can also be added directly to the Model Tree by  right-clicking on the &quot;Connectors&quot; folder and selecting the &quot;New&quot; menu item.</p>

Example of an &quot;Or&quot; type Junction</p>
<p class="boxout"><img src="img/tip.png" width="13" height="18"> Note that Zenta does not currently enforce the  full ZentaMate rules when connecting junctions. You should ensure that only  relationships of the same type (Flow or Triggering) are used to connect  elements and junctions.</p>
