<h2>Connection Bend-points</h2>
<p>A connection line (relationship) can have any number of bend-points so that the connection can be routed to form bends and deviations in the diagram.</p>
<p>To add a bend-point to a connection firstly select the connection. A bend-point  &quot;handle&quot;, or dot, will appear in the middle of the connection:</p>

A connection bend-point &quot;handle&quot;</p>
<p>Drag the bend-point handle in the desired direction. Notice  that as you drag the handle two new bend-point handles are added to the  connection:</p>
<p class="caption"><img src="img/bendpoint2.png" width="387" height="124"><br>
Connection bend-point &quot;handles&quot; appear</p>
<p>You can continue to select  and drag these handles to create new bend-points. As each new bend-point is  created, two new handles will appear either side of the selected handle.</p>
<p>To delete a bend-point,  select the bend-point's handle and drag it so that the connection line becomes straight. Once the connection line is straightened the bend-point will  disappear.</p>
Note - bend-points cannot be added to connections if the Connection Router Type for  the View is set to &quot;Manhattan&quot;. See <a href="view_conn_router.html">here</a> for more details.
