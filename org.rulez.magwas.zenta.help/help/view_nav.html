<h2>Navigating a View</h2>
<h3>Panning</h3>
<p>If you select the first selection tool from the Palette, click somewhere on the View to give it the focus and then hold the Space bar down the cursor will change to a hand and you can pan the View. You can also pan around the View by holding down the middle mouse button.</p>
<h3>Using the Keyboard Instead of the Mouse in a View</h3>
<p>It is possible to move and resize selected objects in a View  by using the computer keyboard instead of a mouse. To move an object, press the period key (&quot;.&quot;)  once to reveal the MOVE cursor. Then use the Arrow keys, followed by the ENTER  key to commit the move. To resize the object, press the period key (&quot;.&quot;) until  the RESIZE cursor appears at the desired resize handle. Press the ENTER key to  commit the resize.</p>
<h3>Automatic Scrolling in a View</h3>
Sometimes  you may find that an element is outside the area of the View area and you wish  to draw a new connection between one element and another element outside of the  View area (the scrollbars would normally need to be used). To do so, simply  click on the source element after selecting the connection tool and then hover  the mouse at the edge of the Viewport. After a short pause, the View will  automatically scroll.
<h3>Zooming a View</h3>
<p>You can zoom in and out of a View in a number of different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the main &quot;View&quot; menu</li>
  <li>By using the shortcut keys Ctrl+ and Ctrl= (&quot;Command&quot; key on Mac)</li>
  <li>By using the Zoom combo box on the main toolbar.</li>
  <li>By holding the Ctrl key down (&quot;Command&quot; key on Mac) and using the mouse scroll wheel</li>
</ul>
<p>Used in combination with the <a href="outline.html">Outline View</a> you can easily navigate around large diagrams.</p>
