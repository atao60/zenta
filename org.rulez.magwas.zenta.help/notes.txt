HTML source notes
-----------------
* Screenshots are based on the Zenta application sized to 1011x763 pixels
* Ensure images in the HTML docs are no wider than 700 pixels
* If an image is sized differently to its original size then set both the height and width attributes of <img> in order to be sized properly in Word
  otherwise if an image is a 1:1 size you can omit both the width and height attributes
* Have one only <p>&nbsp;</p> at the end of each HTML file


Edit the source HTML files
--------------------------
* Edit "front.html" for the Zenta version number
* Ensure "files.list" for the list of files that will be concatenated is up to date
* Ensure "contexts.xml" is up to date
* Ensure "toc.xml" is up to date and corresponds to "files.list"
