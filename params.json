This means - among other things - that model files will be incompatible with other versions for a while.\r\n\r\nZenta is a free, open source, cross-platform tool and editor to create models along with their metamodels.\r\n\r\nZenta is forked from Archi, which is an implementation for the Archimate methodology.\r\nArchimate is a closed standard of the Open Group. Yeah!\r\nThis created a situation where in theory you could use a software with an expressed open source licence only with permission.\r\nAnd anyway, you might want to use other - or more - metamodels.\r\n\r\nZenta is targeted toward all levels of Architects and Modellers. It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e. free) solution to users who may be making their first steps in the architecture modelling or who are looking for a cross-platform modelling tool for their company or institution.\r\n\r\nZenta boasts an export module which can export your model theoretically in any format, and does have styles to do it in docbook, html, opendoc and csv.\r\n\r\nThe export module also does conformance checks to your metamodels.\r\n\r\nMetamodels are easily expressed with graphical models.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
